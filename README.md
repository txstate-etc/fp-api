# fp-api

This API backend works with a seperate view layer found under [fp-view](https://github.com/txstate-etc/fp-view.git).

**To get started**:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Better yet, if you can run the following command in dependent repos or here if you're doing a stand-alone review of the API:
`docker compose up --build`
